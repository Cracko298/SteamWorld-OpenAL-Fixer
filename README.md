# SteamWorld-OpenAL-Fixer
- Fixes SteamWorld games from 2011 up until 2012.

### Supported Games:
- SteamWorld Heist
- SteamWorld Dig
- SteamWorld Dig 2
- SteamWorld Quest

### Excluded Games:
- SteamWorld Tower Defense
- SteamWorld Build
```
Reasoning:

Build          - SteamWorld Build uses Unity, and Not Image & Forms in-house Engine like games such as Quest, or Heist.
Tower Defense  - SteamWorld Tower Defense was only released on the Nintendo DSi, and Not re-released on PC/Console.
